# MRivasPortfolio

MRPortfolio is my very first professional Portfolio.

A portfolio as well as a CV, tells others about your skills, your education and strengths, but a difference of a CV, a Portfolio will utilize visual images and it can be more interactive and detailed than a CV on paper or an email. 

A portfolio is a great way of growing your online presence with the primary goal of getting noticed by potential employers or clients. In this portfolio, I have included information about the work that done so far in the UWA Boot Camp. 

More information will be added as the Boot Camp goes on and we learn more about Coding and Web Development.
