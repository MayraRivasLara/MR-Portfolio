# MR-Portfolio
## Description

This portfolio was created with the goal to reach out to people make connections and to use a visual and interactive tool to get noticed by others with the similar interests and also future employers/clients.

This portfolio is a work in process. It will be updated as the UWA Bootcamp goes on and I build more skills to become a full-stack Web Developer. 

## This is how it looks
