# MRivasPortfolio
## Description

This portfolio was created with the goal to reach people and tell them about my learning process at the Bootcamp and the skills I am developing. This is a visual and interactive tool that will help me to get noticed by others with the similar interests and future employers/clients.

This portfolio is a work in process as it will be updated as UWA Bootcamp goes on and the I build more skills becoming a full-stack Web Developer. 

## This is how it looks
