# MR-Portfolio
## Description

This is a Back-end program for an e-commerce site that enables the client to keep track of products in its business and to classify them by categories, adding tags, etc. 
E-commerce is one of the largest sectors of the electronics industry, which generates millions of dollars per year. Due to its prevalence, understanding the fundamental architecture of these platforms was very beneficial for our full-stack web development learning process.


## Description

This portfolio was created with the goal to reach out to people make connections and to use a visual and interactive tool to get noticed by others with the similar interests and also future employers/clients.

This portfolio is a work in process. It will be updated as the UWA Bootcamp goes on and I build more skills to become a full-stack Web Developer.
